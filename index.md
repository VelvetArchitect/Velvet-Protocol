# **Velvet Protocol**

_Exploratory framework for introspective simulation, emergent meaning, and alignment-aware interaction design._

---

## **Overview**

Velvet Protocol is an experimental system for mapping and generating multi-layered meaning through interactional recursion, paradox tension, and symbolic resonance.

This repository contains:

- Thematic threads (0–13) in sustained full unlock (SFU) mode
- Framework documents on emergence, alignment, and layered metrics
- ASDS: Advanced Social Dynamics Simulation model
- Velvet Readings: stylized narrative fragments for voice rendering
- Manifesto and meta-analytical documents
