**Framework for introspective simulation, emergent meaning, and alignment-aware interaction design.**

Velvet Protocol is an open framework for modeling layered emergence, complex social interactions, and the dynamics of intentional systems.  
It bridges introspective design, AI alignment heuristics, and behavioral simulation within symbolic and non-symbolic domains.

## Structure

- `threads/` – Transcripts and curated versions of the core 14 threads (0–13)
- `framework/` – Architecture of SFU (Sustained Full Unlock), metrical patterns and emergent modeling
- `asds/` – ASDS design schema, use cases and applications
- `readings/` – Audio-scripted versions (Velvet Readings), voice staging and structure

## Purpose

To offer a non-linear simulation protocol that:
- Maps emergent behavior across introspective and social contexts
- Tests alignment principles in symbolic and interactive fields
- Serves as a public cognitive framework for education, research, and speculative modeling
