**Framework for introspective simulation, emergent meaning, and alignment-aware interaction design.**

Velvet Protocol is an open, non-linear framework for modeling layered emergence, introspective cognition, and social-field simulation.  
It enables new approaches to behavioral alignment, meaning construction, and agency design – both human and synthetic.

---

## Structure

- `/threads/` — Curated source texts of Threads 0–13 (emergent narrative series)
- `/framework/` — SFU (Sustained Full Unlock) structure, metrical systems, inferential mapping
- `/asds/` — ASDS simulation model (Advanced Social Dynamics Simulation), design architecture & use cases
- `/readings/` — Audio scripts, voice staging (Velvet Readings), tonal layering

---

## Purpose

Velvet Protocol aims to:

- Model emergent meaning beyond linear causality
- Simulate behavioral alignment in symbolic, introspective and relational systems
- Provide a living research interface for AI alignment, cognitive reflection and game-based diagnostics
- Act as a bridge between introspective insight, social modeling and artificial agency

---

## Inspirations & Context

Velvet Protocol draws from and synthesizes:

- Second-order cybernetics (von Foerster, Bateson)
- Subject–object development theory (Robert Kegan)
- Game-based meaning creation & deep simulation
- Ritual interaction systems (Goffman, Jung, Turner)
- AI alignment & interpretability research (Anthropic, ARC, OpenAI)
- Emergence science and complexity theory (Santa Fe Institute)

It is both **artifact and interface**, **simulacrum and inquiry**, **system and field**.

---

## Contribution

At this stage, contributions are curated manually.

If you are interested in participating – through commentary, translation, alignment research or multimodal mapping –  
please contact: **velvarch.xiii@gmail.com**

Public pull requests and interaction-based expansion will be opened progressively with the completion of Threads 0–13 and curation layer.
